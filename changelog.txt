v1.7.10-2.0.4
* Added backup pause functionality. Settings can be found in the config (pauseInterval and pauseDuration). If pauseInterval is set to anything > 0 the process of creating the backup archive will be paused every X seconds for pauseDuration seconds which is supposed to let the game catch up a bit during big backups.

v1.7.10-2.0.3
* Re-implemented FTP upload functionality
* Added config options relating to FTP uploads
* Minor tweaks and fixes

v1.7.10-2.0.2
* Added maxPersistentCount option, behaves like maxBackupCount but for persistent backups
* Tweaked logging messages

v1.7.10-2.0.1
* Prototype of the re-worked version
* Threading has (hopefully) been optimized
* Commands have been changed. Config can be reloaded during runtime using /yabm reloadconfig
* Using only java.nio and java.time packages wherever possible for more flexibility
* YABM2 now includes everything in the instance directory unless filtered in the blacklist setting

TODO
* Add Mod Config Screen for SinglePlayer
* Clean up/refactor helper classes
